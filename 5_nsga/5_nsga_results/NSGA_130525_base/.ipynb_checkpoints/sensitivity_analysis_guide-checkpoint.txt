BASELINE PARAMETERS
------------------
battery_cost_formula: 977.54 * e^(-0.004*x) with $600/kWh minimum
pv_cost_formula: 1047.3 * e^(-0.002*x) with $750/kW minimum
electricity_escalation: 0.03
discount_rate: 0.07
battery_degradation: 0.01
peak_rate: 0.3971
offpeak_rate: 0.1353
export_rate: 0.033

SUGGESTED SENSITIVITY SCENARIOS
------------------------------
Base Case: Current model parameters

Lower Battery Cost: Battery costs 20% lower
  Parameters to change:
  - battery_cost_formula: 782.03 * e^(-0.004*x) with $480/kWh minimum

Higher Electricity Escalation: Electricity prices rising at 5% annually
  Parameters to change:
  - electricity_escalation: 0.05

Higher Feed-in Tariff: Export rate increased to $0.06/kWh
  Parameters to change:
  - export_rate: 0.06

HOW TO CONDUCT SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
---------------------------------
1. Modify the appropriate parameters in your code
2. Rerun the optimization with the new parameters
3. Compare the results with the baseline case
4. Focus on how the changes affect:
   - Best IRR and NPV values
   - Optimal battery size and PV capacity
   - Shape of the Pareto front
   - Financial viability thresholds

KEY METRICS TO TRACK
------------------
- Best IRR: How much does it improve?
- Best NPV: How much does it increase?
- Optimal system sizes: Do they change significantly?
- Threshold parameters: At what values do batteries become economically viable?
