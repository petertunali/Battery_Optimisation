First Year Savings: $1,593.38
Total 30-Year Savings (undiscounted): $80,199.35

NOTES
-----
- Incremental analysis compares against existing PV-only baseline
- Electricity prices escalate at 3% per year
- Initial electricity rates: Peak = $0.39710/kWh, Off-peak = $0.13530/kWh, Export = $0.03300/kWh
- PV cost calculated using formula: y = 1047.3 * e^(-0.002*x) with minimum $750/kW
- Ground-mounted PV has 20% cost premium
- Battery cost calculated using formula: y = 977.54 * e^(-0.004*x) with minimum $600/kWh
- No battery maintenance costs as per requirements
- PV maintenance cost: $250 per year
- Discount rate for NPV calculation: 7%
